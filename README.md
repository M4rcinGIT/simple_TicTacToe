# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Description

The project consists of a `Board` class that represents the game board and provides methods for displaying the board, making moves, and checking for a win or a draw. 
The game is played between two players, X and O, who take turns marking empty cells on the board.

Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves by entering the coordinates of the desired cell. The game will display the current state of the board after each move and notify you if there is a winner or if it's a draw.
